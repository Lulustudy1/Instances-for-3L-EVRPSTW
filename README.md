# Instances-for-3L-EVRPSTW
Data Description of the Instances:

We present 30 reference instances for the 3L-EVRPSTW problem. These instances are derived from a combination of Schneider's EVRPTW routing instances and Moura and Oliveira's VRPLP loading instances. The instances encompass three types of location distributions: clustered, random, and clustered-random. The primary distinction between C101 and C201 lies in the degree of compactness and dispersion of their respective time windows.

For each instance, we first provide the following node-specific information:

Node identifier
Node type
X and Y coordinates
Delivery demand
Earliest service start time
Latest service time
Service duration
Subsequently, we present the cargo dimension information for each node. For example:
1 120 1 99 1 73 120 2 97 1 67 1 62 1 30 3 81 0 33 1 28 1 10 ...

In this representation, the height-flag indicates whether the given dimension is suitable as a height dimension (1 \= yes, 0 \= no).
